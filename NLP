# Sentiment-analysis-with-Python-NLTK-Scikit-Learn-&-ChatGPT-|-Text-classification-|-Machine-learning

Hey my name is Felipe and welcome to my  channel, in this tutorial I'm going to show  you how to work with natural language processing,  we are going to do sentiment analysis of product  reviews and we are going to work with three very  powerful technologies I'm going to show you how  to use nltk a very popular python library to work  with natural language processing I'm also going  to show you how to train your own text classifier  using scikit learn and we are going to do sentiment  analysis using chatgpt, because remember programming  is changing, is evolving, so we definitely need to  be more familiar with all the different tools and  all the different technologies we have available  in order to do machine learning, I'm going to show  you how to use each one of these super powerful  technologies and I'm also going to show you how  to compare their performances, and now let's get  started, now let's get started with this process  and actually before we get started let me show you  something which is very important is the data we  are going to use in order to do sentiment analysis  remember we are going to do sentiment analysis  of product reviews and we obviously need data in  order to work on this tutorial and this the data  we will be using today you can see that this is  a CSV file and we have two columns one of them is  called text and the other one is sentiment you can  see that the text is the text of the review for  example this one over here is the product broke  after one use and the sentiment is negative so  this means this is a negative review this one over  here let me show you a positive review for example  this one over here happy with my purchase will buy  again and this is an example of a positive review  and so on right you get the idea top tier quality  worth every penny this another positive review  then... this one over here 'so cheap' and this is an  example of a negative review and so on right you  get the idea we have many many reviews we have the  text of the reviews and we also have the sentiment  and you can see that the sentiment is binary  absolutely every single one of these reviews is  either negative or positive so this is all about  the data and now let's get started with this  process let's get back to Google collab and let  me show you how to work on this tutorial so the  first thing we will need to do is to install all  the python packages all the requirements we need  in order to work on this project and you can see  that these requirements are openai pandas nltk  and scikit learn so this is definitely the first  step in this process and something that's very  important you can see that in my case I am working  in a Google collab I am working on a Jupiter  notebook in Google collab but you can do whatever  you want you can just decide to do exactly the  same as me you can also work in a google col if you  want or you can just take this Jupiter notebook  and you can work on your local environment on your  local computer or you can just copy and paste all  the code we will be using today and execute all  this code from your local computer absolutely  every single thing I'm going to be doing today  you can do it from a google colab or you can just do  it in your local computer now let's continue, you  can see that the next cell is this one over here  which is about the data this is where we are going  to download the data we are going to be using  in this project and then we are going to load  the data using pandas, the way we are going  to download the data into this Jupiter notebook  is by using this python library over here which  is called gdown, you don't need to install this  Python Library if you also work in a Google collab  but in case you are working on your local computer  you will need to install this package too now let  me show you something, let me show you my Google  Drive you can see I have this file over here which  is reviews.csv and this is obviously exactly the  same file I showed you in in my local computer so  perhaps one of the easiest ways to download this  file into this Google collab is to use gdown and  let me show you how to do it I'm going to make  this file publicly available so I'm going to share...  share... and I am going to click over here anyone  with the link and I'm going to copy this link I'm  going to click on done and then I'm going to get  back here to this Google colab and the only thing  I'm going to do is to replace this value with the  file id which is this one over here... this one over  here right everything that's in between these two...  characters, right, this one and this one so we're  just going to copy everything that's over here and  we're going to paste it over there right that's  the only thing we need to do in order to download  this file into this google colab and then you  can see that we are just reading this file using  pandas using this python library over here and  then we are getting the first review we are  reading the first review and we are just printing  this first review so let me show you what happens  when I execute this cell you can see that we are  downloading this file and this... the first review  is the product broke after one use, right, remember  that's exactly the first review I showed you over here,so we are over here we are reading the file  and we are accessing the text column so these are  all the texts of all of our reviews and if we  access the index number zero we are accessing  the first review right now let's continue this is  going to be pretty much all in order to download  the data into this Jupiter notebook and now let me  show you how to do sentiment analysis with nltk  you can see that the first step in this process  is to import nltk then we need to execute this  instruction this is very important don't forget  to execute this instruction over here and then the  only thing we are doing is importing this object  from this package from nltk dot sentiment this  is a very important object and this exactly the  object we will be using in order to do sentiment  analysis and please mind how how easy this is the  only thing we are doing over here is creating a  new instance of this object and then we are  just calling this function polarity scores we  are putting a review as input and that's pretty  much all we need to do in order to classify this  review's sentiment you can see that we are getting  a number and if this number is greater than zero  means this is a positive review and if this  number is lesser than than zero it means this  is a negative review so this is how easy it is  to do sentiment analysis using nltk you thought  that machine learning was hard you thought it  was very complex and very like only the expert  can do machine learning you can see how easy  it is you can see how easy is to do sentiment  analysis using this powerful library which is nltk,  in only a few instructions we are classifying the  sentiment of our reviews let me show you how it  works I'm going to execute this cell and you can  see that the review we have here is this product  was awful and this is obviously a negative review  and this is exactly what we are printing over  here we are printing negative so everything  works just fine let me do another example I'm  going to input 'what an amazing product... I love it... oh my God... amazing' and let's see what happens  here you can see that this is a positive review  so everything seems to be working just fine and  you can see that in only a few instructions we  are doing sentiment analysis and this is pretty  much all so this is going to be all for this cell  over here and now let's continue to the next step  in this process which is doing sentiment analysis  with scikit learn and this is where I'm going to show  you how to do text classification, how to train  your own text classifier, because if you think  about sentiment analysis you can see that the  input is text and we are classifying this text  into different categories so actually we are  doing text classification, sentiment analysis is  only a sub field of text classification, so this  where I'm going to show you how to train your  own text classifier and this is how we're going  to do you can see in this case we have a few more  instructions so this is not going to be as easy  as we have over here with nltk but is going to  be slightly more complex only slightly more  complex, we are doing a lot of imports over here  then we are taking all the texts of our reviews  right you can see we are getting absolutely all  of the reviews so we are saving all the text in  this variable which is called features and then  we are saving all the sentiments in this other  variable which is called labels and once we have  extracted the texts and the labels the only thing  we are doing over here in this other instruction  is to call train test split and the only thing  this is going to do is to split all of our data  into two sets, the training set and the test set,  we are going to use the training set in order to  train our test classifier and we are going to use  the test set in order to evaluate its performance  so this is a very important step and remember the  only thing we are doing over here is to... is  splitting all of our data into two different  sets, now let's continue remember I told you we  are going to do text classification and the way  these classifiers we are going to be using today  the way they work we need to convert all of our  text into numerical values that's how it works we  definitely need to convert all the characters  and all the text into numerical values in order to  use the classifier we are going to use in order to  train this model so we need to take all the texts  of our reviews and we need to convert all these  texts into numerical values we need to transform  all of our texts into numerical values and there  are many different ways in which we can do this  conversion, this transformation, many different  ways but the way we are going to do it in this  tutorial in this part of this process is by using  this object we have over here and the only thing  we are going to do with this object is just  making this conversion right so the input is  going to be text the input is going to be all  the texts of our reviews and the output is going  to be exactly the same information but we are  going to convert this information into numerical  values long story short we are taking the data  and we are transforming this data into another  representation we are only transforming the data  but it's exactly the same data it's exactly the  same information the only thing we are doing is  transforming this data so we can use it in order  to train this classifier right now let's continue  with this process, then the only thing we need  to do is to create this classifier and we need  to train the classifier and the only thing we  need to do in order to train this classifier is  to call this method over here which is fit and  that's pretty much all and then we just need to  see how it performs in the test data and that's  it remember I told you that in this case case it  was going to be slightly more complex than in the  previous case of using nltk but only slightly more  complex because you can see that it's very easy  too right maybe we have twice as many instructions  as before right it's pretty much twice as many  instructions but it's a very simple process  nevertheless so now the only thing I'm going to  do is to press enter and that's pretty much all  and you can see that the process is completed  it took only a couple of seconds and in this  process we are training the model and we are also  predicting the test set and we are evaluating how  it performs on the test set and you can see  that we are getting a 92.7% accuracy so this  is definitely a very high value of accuracy and we  are completed with the second step in this process  which is doing sentiment analysis with scikit learn  you can see how easy it was, you thought machine  learning was hard you thought machine learning was  complex oh think again take a look at how fast we  are going and take a look at how we are doing all  this sentiment analysis we are just using these  very powerful technologies very powerful tools  and we are just classifying the sentiment  of our texts in only a couple of seconds... we are training an entire classifier in 1 second...and now it is timeto do sentiment analysis with chatGPT because  remember once again and I'm going to say it many  many times programming is changing programming  is evolving and now we have many tools we didn't  have a few years ago and these other tools are  definitely very important because remember if  you are a programmer if you are a developer if you  are an engineer you need to be familiar with many  different tools so you know which one to choose in  different situations right and using cahtgpt I think  it could be a very interesting choice in many  different situations so let me show you how we're  going to do now using chatgpt is only as a matter of  speaking because we are going to be using openai  API it's pretty much the same as using chatGPT but  actually we are going to use the openAI API so  let me show you the high level idea the high level  approach of how this works you can see we are  creating a new client over here and this is only  like a very simple definition the only thing we're  doing is calling this object over here we are  specifying our API key I'm going to show you how  to find your API key and then we are defining this  prompt which says something like this classify the  sentiment of this review and this is an example of  the review I'm using now which which is 'not great'  sentiment is binary either positive or negative  return only the sentiment so we are instructing  chatgpt or actually we're instructing the openai API  to classify the sentiment of a given review and  the we are telling that the sentiment is binary  either positive or negative and we are asking the  openai API to return only the sentiment then we  are calling this other function over here which  the only thing we are doing is just calling the  openai API you can see that this is our prompt  over here and then this is how we are going to  get the response and then the only thing we are  going to do is we are going to verify if we got a  response saying it's positive or negative, remember  we are asking the openai API to return only the  sentiment so ideally this is going to return only  the sentiment but as a way to be a little on the  safe side is that I decided to implement it like  this we are going to verify we are going to see  if the word positive is within our response right  so maybe the openai API decides to reply with  something like this review is positive so we're  only going to verify if this word is contained  in the answer we got from the openai API and  that's pretty much all so let me show you how it  works I'm going to execute it exactly like this but  obviously first I need to show you how to get  your openai key so you need to go to platform.openai.com  then you need to go to your API keys and  you need to create a new secret key I'm going to  call this new secret key something like sentiment  analysis tutorial, create secret key, you can see  that the new key has been generated the only thing I'm  going to do is to copy the key over here and I'm  going to paste it over here okay and something  very important about this API key is that this  is very private please do not share this key  with absolutely anyone noone ever because  this is your own private key do not never share  this key with anyone and never do something as  stupid as I am doing right now which is making a  video displaying my API key with everyone and  making this completely public never do something  like this never do something like this right this  is very dangerous and this is definitely not a  good practice once this tutorial is completed  I'm just going to delete this key but even then I  think this is not a good security practice anyway  so never do something like I am doing right now  please remember to keep your API key very private  because otherwise you could have different  type of issues now let's continue the only  thing I'm going to do now is to press enter and  let's see what happens, and you can see that we are  getting negative because we are classifying this  review over here let me show you I'm going to try  with another review something like... remember this  is a product review so let's try with something  like 'oh my God... this product... Oh my God... I'm happy'  let's see what happens there, and you can see we  are getting a positive review right so everything  is okay, so this is pretty much all on how to use  chatgpt to do sentiment analysis you can see how  easy it was you can see how super easy it was  and something else which is very important about  using the openai API is that this is actually  not free but this is something you will need to  pay for, right, please remember that if you use  the openai API this is not going to be free but  you are going to spend a few cents or you are  going to spend a few dollars if you use it a lot  because this is not a free service, right, this is  a very important thing to keep in mind now let's  continue and you can see that this is pretty much  all I already showed you how to use these three  very powerful technologies and now the only thing  we need to do is to compare their performances  to see which which one performs better and this  is the only coding we will be doing today so  let me show you how to do it, the first thing  I'm going to do is a few changes over here because  I'm going to convert each one of these cells we  have over here each one of these functions and  all of this code we have over here I'm going  to convert into a function... and this some going  to be something like this def sentiment analysisnltk and the input is going to be text and we are  going to do something like this now this is going  to be text right this input we have over here  and then we are going to... instead of printing we  are going to return either the word positive or  the word negative... and that's pretty much all, so  you can see the only thing I did over here was  converting the code we had into a function and  that's it so we can just call this function  from a much higher level we input the text  of our review and we get the sentiment of our  review in the output right I'm going to show  you how to use it in a couple of minutes but  for now just keep in mind this is what we are  doing over here and the only thing I'm going  to do is to press enter again because we  need to save this new function into our memory  now let's continue I'm going to do exactly the  same over here... and this is how I'm going to  do... sentiment analysis... scikit learn... the input  is going to be text.... and then... we are going to say  something like this... it's going to be prediction...text... and we don't care about  the accuracy score anymore so  we are going to return... if positive in prediction...zero...okay I'm not complete sure this is okay we are  going to verify it in a few minutes maybe we  need to make a very small adjustment but  this is basically okay maybe we need to do like  a very very small edit but for now this is  pretty much all we have completed this other  function over here I'm going to press enter  again okay and now let's continue over here  I am going to... over here... def sentiment analysis...  let's say chatgpt we are not really using chatgpt  this is the openai API but it's pretty much the  same... the input is text... and then something like this...and this is how...we are going to do, okay, okay something like this, it  seems we don't have any error so everything's okay  and then instead of printing we are going to  return positive and negative okay and the only  thing I'm going to do is to press enter and that's  pretty much all and now let's continue with this  part over here and let's compare the performances  of these three different technologies let's see  how we can do that, so I'm going to create three  variables which are score nltk this is going to be zero...then score scikit learn is going to  be zero too, and score chatgpt and this is going to  be zero too, okay then the only thing I'm going  to do is to iterate for j in range len reviews  remember reviews is the object  we have over here, the table, the data we  are reading right, reviews is all this  file we have over here with all of our  reviews and all the sentiments of our reviews  and then we are going to say text equal toreviews text j and then that's pretty much all  then the only thing we need to do  is to call... sentiment analysis nltk...we are going to input the  text of our review and if this value...we are going to ask if this value  if the value we got from this function  is exactly the same sentiment we have  for this review and this is how we are  going to verify it, we are going  to ask if this value over here is in...reviews... or maybe the best way to do  it will be something like this sentimentreviews...sentiment j, so this is the text  and this is the sentiment this is the  ground truth this is the real sentiment the  actual sentiment from this review and we are  going to ask we are going to verify if the  sentiment we got using nltk is exactly the  same sentiment for this review right so this  is exactly what we have over here and in case  it is the same we are going to increase this  counter by one unit right and in case it's  not we are not going to do anything and then we  are going to do exactly the same for the otherfunctions... and we are going to say something like  this... we are going to say this  is scikit learn... and we are going to...do something like this score chatgpt... chatgpt... and that's pretty much all...then we are going to... at the  end we are going to... divide thisby the number of reviews...and we are going to do the   same... for these other two variables over here...  okay and then pretty much all and  the only thing we need to do now is to print...score ... nltk... score.... nltk...score scikit learn equal to score scikit learn  and score chagpt equal to score chatgpt okay that's  pretty much all let's see what happens I'm going  to execute this cell and let's compare their  performances, we got an error let's see why let me  show you the problem we have is related to this  function over here sentiment analysis scikit learn  remember I told you a few minutes ago that we need  to convert the reviews from text into numerical  values otherwise this is not going to work and  if you can see this function over here we are  not converting the review into numerical values  so we need to do something like this I'm going  to copy... and paste over here and this is going  to be... something like this... and maybe we  can just call it like this it doesn't matter a  very dummy variable... and like this okay so we are  converting the text of the review into a numerical  value and then we are just making the prediction  of this numerical value and that's pretty much  all so I'm going to execute this cell again so we  save this function into memory and now let's try  to execute it one more time and let's see what  happens, okay and now these are the results you  can see that with nltk we got a 74% accuracy with  scikit learn with the classifier we trained using  scikit learn we got a 98% accuracy which is a very  good performance and with chatgpt with the openai API  we got a 93% accuracy so these are pretty much  the results and if we look at the results the  best performance is with scikit learn right with the  classifier we trained with scikit learn, but in order  to be fair let me tell you something that's very  important about this results remember that when we  trained this classifier using scikit learn remember we  split the data into two sets the training set and  the test set and we are using the training set  in order to train this classifier so actually  most of the reviews we are classifying over  here... most of these reviews are the same  reviews we used in order to train the classifier  so actually I am not really that surprised that we  got such a high performance but it doesn't matter  remember this was only a very quick tutorial and  a very high level tutorial only to show you how  to work with sentiment analysis and only to show  you how to work with these three super powerful  and super amazing tools to do sentiment analysis  that was pretty much the idea of today's tutorial  and something else which is also very important is  that you can see that we are getting a very high  performance with chatgpt, with the openai API, you  can see that we are getting a 93% accuracy, now  remember the data I showed you? remember the data  we are using in order to work on this project? well  I created this dataset using chatGPT so that's  another thing that doesn't really make this  comparison very fair at all because we are using  chatgpt in order to create the data and we are also  using chatgpt in order to make predictions so yeah  it doesn't really make a lot of sense to compare  these three algorithms in the way we are doing it  but once again it doesn't matter it was only a  way to show you how to work with all these very  powerful technologies and about the data remember  this is a dataset I created using chatgpt and if you  are curious if you want to know exactly how  I created this amazing dataset using chatgpt  I invite you to take a look at other of my previous  videos where I show you the entire process of how  I create a sentiment analysis synthetic dataset  using chatgpt so I definitely invite you to watch this  previous video this was a very cool project it  was a very awesome project and in this previous  video I tell you exactly how you can generate the  same dataset we are using in today's tutorial so  definitely take a look at this previous video  but if you don't want to go through the hustle  of creating the entire dataset yourself don't  worry you can just go to my patreon because the  dataset is available to all my patreon supporters  so you can either create the entire dataset  yourself by watching my previous video or you  can just go to my patreon and... subscribe to my  patreon, and then download the dataset we have  used in today's tutorial so this is going to be  all for today my name is Felipe I'm a computer  vision engineer and see you on my next video.

NLP project | Creating a sentiment analysis synthetic dataset with ChatGPT

On today's tutorial we are going to work with  sentiment analysis, I'm going to show you how  to create a sentiment analysis synthetic  dataset using chatgpt, this is going to be a  very advanced machine learning tutorial and  we're going to get more familiar with natural  language processing, sentiment analysis and with  how to create synthetic datasets, if you are a  machine learning engineer learning how to create a  synthetic dataset is definitely a very important  skill that's going to help you a lot in your  career, you know that every single time you train  a machine learning model you need data obviously  and the data you use to train this model should  ideally be real data but there are many situations  in which you don't really have access to real data,  maybe you are working on a super custom project  and... you don't really have access, there's not any  publicly available dataset you can use in your  custom project or maybe you do have access to  publicly available datasets you can use in order  to train your models but the datasets may not be  open source so you may not be able to use them in  your project or even if they are open source,  even in that situation you need to comply with  different type of licenses and different type  of copyright related restrictions so even if they  are open source you may not be able to use them in  your project either so there are different type of  situations in which you don't have access to real  data and learning how to create a synthetic dataset  is a very important skill for sure, because  you can just go ahead and create your own data  to train your models, so let me show you, we will  be using chatgpt and we will be using chatgpt user  interface, we will be using exactly this user  interface over here in chat.openai.com and this  is going to be enough in order to show you the  overall process of how I create this synthetic  dataset, technically, ideally, we should be using  something like the openai API or we should be using  some python functions or some python code in order  to create this dataset because by doing so we  would have much more control on everything that's  going to be generated, right, you're are going to  see what I mean later on, but just remember that  we are going to use chatgpt and we're going to use  this user interface only as a way to show you  the overall process but technically if we  would use some python code we would do this  process much faster and much better and much more  efficiently and so on, so we will be generating a  sentiment analysis dataset and more specifically  we will be creating a dataset of product reviews,  so we are going to have many product reviews and  for every single one of our reviews we are going  to have a label which will be either positive  or negative, right, and the label will be the  sentiment of that review and this is the dataset  we will be generating today, and in a future  tutorial I'm going to show you how to use this  dataset in order to train a machine learning  model but for now let's take it one step at a time  so the first thing I'm going to do is I'm going  to tell chatgpt exactly what we will be doing today  so I will be creating some context so chatgpt knows  what this project is about and I will be saying  something like this: I'm preparing a sentiment  analysis synthetic dataset of product reviews,  the label is binary: positive or negative, give  me 10 reviews and their sentiment. And this is what we  got, for example this review over here this product  exceeded my expectations it's absolutely fantastic  and worth every penny and this is an example of a  positive review then I was really disappointed  with this product it didn't work as advertised  and it was a waste of money and this is  an example of a negative review then I love this  product it changed my life for the better, highly  recommend it to everyone and this is another  example of another positive review and then  another example terrible quality broke after just  a few uses definitely not worth the price and this  another negative review so this is the type of  content we will be generating and this is how we  will be creating our synthetic dataset, and there  are many things I have to say from here the first  one is that at the end of all this process we  will ask chatgpt to give us this dataset in a CSV  format, right, it will be much better in order to  generate our dataset in order to just work with  this dataset so that's something we are going to  do later on on this tutorial but for now as we  are just playing around as we are just starting  with this process this is what we got, right, this  is really not the format we are going to generate  later on, and then another thing which is very  important when you create a synthetic dataset you  obviously want to make this dataset as similar  as possible to the real data, right, obviously  that's the entire purpose of creating a synthetic  dataset that you will be creating something that  looks like the real data so you want to create  a very diverse dataset which kind of looks like  the diversity you will have in a real dataset  and if I look at all of these reviews over here  the first thing I notice is that all of these  reviews are very extreme, right, absolutely every  single one of these reviews is super positive or  super negative and that's perfectly fine because  these are product reviews but the way it works  in real life there are many reviews which are  positive but are slightly positive and there are  other reviews which are negative but only slightly  negative and also there are many other reviews  which is really hard to tell if it's positive  or negative right many reviews which are kind of neutral, we want this datset to look as  real as possible so we are going to create other  reviews other type of reviews which are going to  be much more diverse so this is what we are going  to do next, give me 10 reviews and their sentiment but  now let's let's ask chatgpt not a binary label but  let's make something a little more complex, sentiment  should be an integer between - 3 and 3,  -3 is the most negative sentiment and 3 is  the most positive sentiment and let's see what  happens and this is what we got so for example  we have: absolutely dreadful product broke within  minutes of use and this is a very negative review  this is like the most negative review then very  disappointed with this purchase doesn't live  up to the hype, right, we have all these words over  here I'm not sure how realistic these words are  I think people doesn't really speak like this  but it doesn't matter and this is a negative  review but not so negative as the other one then  average product nothing special about it this  is a negative review but only slightly negative  right and then the same happens with the positive  reviews a good product overall does the job well  slightly positive then extremely satisfied with  this purchase exactly what I needed and this is  a super positive review and so on right so by  doing this change over here now we have much more  diversity in the reviews we are getting from chatgp...  -3 the most negative sentiment and  3 the most positive sentiment, I'm going to  ask 10 reviews too now give me 10 reviews and  I'm going to do something else because you can  see that each one of the reviews we are getting  over here they are very well written, right, you  can see that we have all the punctuation over here  we have everything starting with an uppercase we  have everything like very nice looking right  and the way people write the reviews usually  you will have many people who really writes  like this and then you will have many other  people who just use a much more informal type of  writing right so let's ask chatgpt... use a more informal writing...do not respect punctuation...nor upper cases... let's see now,okay now we have something  which looks much nicer for sure and this is what  we got this product sucks and this is a very  negative review I am disappointed with it and  this is a a negative review but not so negative  like the other one and you can see that we have a  much different style of writing that we had over  here right much different style, just okay,  it's awesome, works like a charm, not bad, waste of  money, love it, pretty good, not impressed, right, so  you can see that we have even more diversity  because there will be many people who really  write the reviews like this and then there  will be other people who just writes like this, now  let's do a little more... let's ask chatgpt for a  little more diversity, now let's use an extremely formal...extremely formal writing... each review should be more  than 300 characters long, right, because you  we know that there are many people who write very  long reviews, some very very super curated reviews,  and yeah we want to have a very diverse  dataset, this is key, every time you create  a synthetic dataset you want your dataset to be  as diverse as possible because you want this dataset  to resemble the real data and the real data  will be super diverse so for example... in light of  my extensive examination I am pleased to pronounce  this product as truly remarkable it's exceptional  performance surpasses all anticipations evoking  a profound sense of satisfaction hence it merits  the highest sentiment of 3... I see that it's  not really complying with the CSV format right  but nevertheless you get the idea and please  mind that chatgpt very often makes mistakes I'm  not sure if very often but sometimes it makes  mistakes so you will need to be on top of all  the results to make sure everything complies  with everything you are asking chatgpt, I have seen  that when we have many restrictions for example  here we are asking 10 reviews CSV format two  columns the sentiment from -3 to 3.  extremely formal writing 300 characters long  we have many restrictions, we are not going to  see some of the restrictions or some of the  things we are asking chatgpt, for example in this  case we are asking for a csv format and this is  not in csv format but nevertheless remember that  this tutorial is only to show you how to create  a synthetic dataset, to show you the overall  process of how to create a synthetic dataset,  so obviously there are many things we could do  much better or we could improve in this process  but this is only to show you the overall idea of  how to do it remember that chatgpt is an amazing tool  but sometimes it makes mistake and as a matter of  fact we have a text over here which says chatgpt can  make mistakes so we we will have some mistakes  from time to time so just you need to  remember that you need to be on top of all the  results and everything that's being generated  because sometimes it will not comply with what  you have asked chatgpt, but nevermind let's continue  with this process, so basically we are generating a  very diverse dataset, we are generating this dataset  in CSV format and we are making different  type of diversities right we have different  graduations of the positive and the negative sentiments,  and we also have a longer text we have shorter text  and also we have more formal and more informal  writing now let's make something with grammar  mistakes because there are many people who also  writes with a very informal and very... wrong  writing right with many... with a lot of grammar  mistakes, so I'm going to say something like this...Now give me 10 reviews in CSV format two  columns text and sentiment, sentiment  is an integer from -3 to 3, -3 is  the most negative sentiment and 3 the most  positive sentiment, with a lot of syntax mistakes  and informal writing, each review should be less  than 20 characters long. And you can see that now  we have 'this sucks' with an X at the end I hate  it it's okay it's great with an 8, it works  good not bad waste money love it and this is  also very realistic because there are many people  who really writes a review like this right so  you get the idea of what we are trying to do  over here and now what I'm going to do is to  ask chatgpt to provide many reviews at once and we are  going to start creating this dataset so this  is how I'm going to do I have prepared something  over here and you can see that this is the text  we are going to input into chatgpt which is exactly  what we have... like the overall idea of what we  have done so far we are going to ask for product  reviews and sentiment, the sentiment should be an  integer and actually should be a signed integer  because we only care about the positives and  the negatives and we don't really care about all  these reviews which are generated as zero right  because technically this is not positive and  it's not negative either so we are going to ask  for signed integers and ranging from -3 to  3, -3 is the most negative one, 3 is  the most positive and the 60 reviews should be  comprised as follow... not only we want to have a  very diverse dataset but we also want to have  pretty much the same amount of data in all of  our categories right so this is going to be a  way to... to create this diversity, then give me the  result in csv format two columns one of them is  the text of the review and the other one is the  sentiment and let's just start with this, so this  is what we got, these are all the reviews we got  and you can see that we are making progress for  sure because now we are making... we are producing  a lot of reviews, we are producing everything in  exactly the same format we are looking for  right we are producing a CSV file or a CSV type  of structure and we have many many reviews and  this is a very balanced dataset because all of  our categories have the same amount of objects  now something that's very important remember  we are actually creating a binary dataset, right  all of our labels are actually binary all of our  labels are either positive or negative so at the  end of this process once we have finalized all the  content creation all the reviews creation we are  just going to replace all these numbers by the  sentiment right by either positive or negative  we are going to replace all the numbers  -3, -2 and -1 by negative and we're  going to replace all the numbers 1 2 and 3  by the the word 'positive', right, remember at the end  we are creating a binary label we are creating  a synthetic dataset with only two sentiments, positive  or negative, but this is only something we are  doing in the meanwhile only to make sure we are  creating a more balanced dataset and a more diverse  dataset, so let's continue now we're going to create  exactly the same but I'm going to input something  like... this thing we did over here... and let's see  what happened with a lot of syntax mistakes and  informal writing each review should be less than  20 characters long... and that should be pretty much  all, and this is what we got you can see that for  example unbelievable incredible the best these  are... perfection, these are like the most positive  reviews and then we also have all the other ones,  okay I guess, not the worst, kinda okay, junk,  and so on I think this is the type of text I like  the most because I think this is the most real one  right people really speak like this when they are  writing a review, and now we are going to do the same for  example with the extremely formal writing and by  now you got the idea, extremely formal... writing,  right we are just going to repeat the same process  many times and we are just going to generate a lot  of reviews and then the only thing we're going  to do is to copy all of these reviews together  and we are just going to create a huge csv file  okay so this is what it generated and you can  see that now we are complying with the format  we asked chatgpt right this is a CSV format and  something I have noticed when I was preparing  this tutorial and I notice the same issue now  that after a few times, a few iterations, chatgpt  starts to repeat a lot of the reviews right  you can see that the text is pretty much the same,  is exactly the same in this two reviews over here  the same happens over here the same happens over  here, over here, over here, so there are many reviews  which are just repeating theirselves right we  have a lot of diversity over here and then we  start to get all these repetitions over here so  this is something we need to be very careful and  we will need to curate a lot of these reviews  later on right once we are creating the dataset  we need to curate all of this content over  here, let's do something different which is also  going to make a much more diverse dataset, let's  create... each review less than 30 characterslong do not respect upper cases nor punctuation  and let's ask chatgpt to make product reviews  about a very specific product which is another  way to make this dataset more diverse because  some of the reviews will be very generic, people  will say things like this something super generic  which will apply to absolutely any type of  product but there will be other people which  will make some comments about a very specific  product which was the product that person  bought right so let's ask chatgpt to give us some  reviews about earplugs for sleeping, which by  the way it's a product I do buy every once in a  while, I test different brands and different type  of earplugs and so on, so let's see what happens  if we ask chatgpt for product reviews but about a  very specific product let's see what happens, you  can see that we have many reviews which are very  generic but then we have other reviews which are  more specific to what a review about earplugs for  sleeping could could look like right for example  this one is about how uncomfortable it is then  annoying, noisy, okay yeah it could be, can't sleep  uncomfortable, hurt ears, right, this is definitely  very... a very appropriate review for an earplug  for sleeping, now let's make it without the restriction...and I see the reviews it generated it seems it  remembers the last... input we put into chatgpt so  it's generating the same type of reviews, I'm  going to ask for each review around 200 characters  long, respect upper cases, and you can see that now  we got longer reviews, we have the same issue as  before some of the reviews look very similar so  we will need to curate all of these reviews later  on but then we have many reviews which are more  specific to the type of product we are reviewing,  right, so I cannot sleep with these earplugs in  they are useless and don't block out any noise  that's very specific to the type of product we are  using, they don't block out any noise, too big  for my ears, let's see a positive  review... we have one over here impressed these  ear plugs are fantastic at blocking out noise  and comfortable to wear so this is exactly what  we have using this input over here and this is the  overall process of how to generate a sentiment  analysis synthetic dataset with chatgpt, I'm  going to keep on trying different inputs, different  prompts, so I generate a very diverse dataset and  then at the end I am going to curate all of these  issues we have over here, of all of these different  reviews which are just repeating their themselves,  right, you can see it's pretty much the same review  but it's repeating itself once and again so I'm  going to curate all of these issues and then I  am going to post the dataset I am generating  in this tutorial in my Patreon so it's going to  be available to all my Patreon supporters, if you  want to download exactly the same dataset I am  generating right now you are going to find this  dataset in my Patreon, this is going to be all  for this tutorial and I also invite you to take  a look at one of my previous videos where I show  you how to create an emotion recognition synthetic  dataset, I show you how to generate human faces  so we can train an emotion recognition model so  I invite you to take a look at that video  over there and this is going to be all for  this tutorial, my name is Felipe, I'm a computer  vision engineer and see you on my next video.


1. **Introduce NLP Tools**: Demonstrate how to utilize powerful technologies such as NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) for sentiment analysis, scikit-learn for training text classifiers, and ChatGPT for enhanced analysis.
  
2. **Hands-On Implementation**: Walk viewers through the practical steps needed to analyze sentiment from product reviews, using a dataset provided in CSV format containing product review texts and their corresponding sentiments (positive or negative).

3. **Comparison of Technologies**: Educate viewers on how to compare the performance of NLTK and scikit-learn in performing sentiment analysis.

### Expected Outcomes

- **Familiarity with NLP Libraries**: Viewers will learn to use NLTK to classify sentiment easily through basic coding, showcasing how approachable machine learning can be.
  
- **Building a Classifier**: Participants will gain experience in using scikit-learn to train their own text classifiers, understanding the more involved process of text classification.
  
- **Data Handling Skills**: Learners will acquire skills in managing data through libraries like Pandas and understand how to leverage Google Colab for running Python code efficiently.

- **Hands-On Experience**: The tutorial emphasizes practical execution, allowing viewers to replicate the steps either in Google Colab or on their local machines.

bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical application of NLP techniques in sentiment analysis, enhancing the viewer’s understanding and skills in machine learning and data processing.


1. **Data Preparation**:
   - All product reviews' text is stored in a variable named `features`, while the corresponding sentiments are stored in a variable named `labels`.
   - The data is split into two sets: a training set to train the classifier and a test set to evaluate its performance using `train_test_split`.

2. **Text to Numerical Conversion**:
   - To train the classifiers, text data needs to be converted into numerical values. This is essential for machine learning models to process the information effectively.
   - The tutorial specifies using a particular method to achieve this transformation, ensuring the text is represented in a numerical format for model usage.

3. **Classifier Training**:
   - A classifier is created and trained by calling a `fit` method on the training data.
   - The complexity of training with scikit-learn is noted to be slightly more than using NLTK, but overall, the process is straightforward and quick.

4. **Performance Evaluation**:
   - Upon training, the model is tested, achieving an accuracy of 92.7%, demonstrating effective sentiment classification.

5. **Using the OpenAI API**:
   - The tutorial progresses to employing the OpenAI API for sentiment analysis, presenting it as an evolution of programming tools.
   - The API requires an API key for access, which should be kept private.
   - A prompt is defined to request sentiment classification from the API, and the code checks the API's response for either "positive" or "negative" sentiment.

6. **Execution Example**:
   - Demonstrations show the classification of various reviews, confirming that the OpenAI API returns correct sentiment outputs.

7. **Cost Awareness**:
   - Users are informed that utilizing the OpenAI API is not free, and costs may incur based on usage.

8. **Comparison of Technologies**:
   - The tutorial concludes with plans to compare the performance of the three technologies (NLTK, scikit-learn, and OpenAI API) and consolidate the functions into reusable format to facilitate this comparison.

9. **Function Conversion**:
   - The tutorial explains transforming code into defined functions for simplicity and better structure, allowing for a higher-level calling of sentiment analysis methods. 


1. **Initialization**:
   - Three variables for scores (`score_nltk`, `score_sklearn`, and `score_chatgpt`) are initialized to zero. These will track the accuracy for each sentiment analysis method.

2. **Iterating Through Reviews**:
   - A loop iterates through each review in the `reviews` dataset. The text of each review is extracted.

3. **Sentiment Analysis**:
   - The text is analyzed for sentiment using the three different methods:
     - The predicted sentiment from NLTK is compared with the actual sentiment (`reviews.sentiment[j]`) to see if they match. If they do, the NLTK score is incremented.
     - The same process is repeated for sentiments predicted by the scikit-learn classifier and ChatGPT.
   - After all reviews are processed, each score is normalized by dividing by the total number of reviews.

4. **Printing Results**:
   - The final scores for NLTK, scikit-learn, and ChatGPT are printed to compare their performances.

5. **Error Identification**:
   - An error occurs because the scikit-learn function does not convert text to numerical values before making predictions. The code is adjusted to include this conversion.

6. **Results Presentation**:
   - After correcting the error, the accuracy results are:
     - **NLTK**: 74%
     - **Scikit-Learn**: 98%
     - **ChatGPT**: 93%
   - Scikit-learn performs the best, but it’s emphasized that the training set used for the classifier overlaps with the test set, leading to potentially inflated performance metrics.

### Important Considerations
- The tutorial notes that using ChatGPT to create the dataset used in the analysis might skew the comparison of the accuracies, as the model has potentially "seen" the training data.
- The presenter acknowledges that the tutorial is primarily educational, showcasing how to use these technologies rather than providing a rigorous comparative analysis.
- Viewers are invited to check the presenter’s previous videos for more detailed information on creating datasets and working with these tools. There is also a call to action for viewers to access the dataset via Patreon if they do not want to create it themselves.

On today's tutorial we are going to work with  sentiment analysis, I'm going to show you how  to create a sentiment analysis synthetic  dataset using chatgpt, this is going to be a  very advanced machine learning tutorial and  we're going to get more familiar with natural  language processing, sentiment analysis and with  how to create synthetic datasets, if you are a  machine learning engineer learning how to create a  synthetic dataset is definitely a very important  skill that's going to help you a lot in your  career, you know that every single time you train  a machine learning model you need data obviously  and the data you use to train this model should  ideally be real data but there are many situations  in which you don't really have access to real data,  maybe you are working on a super custom project  and... you don't really have access, there's not any  publicly available dataset you can use in your  custom project or maybe you do have access to  publicly available datasets you can use in order  to train your models but the datasets may not be  open source so you may not be able to use them in  your project or even if they are open source,  even in that situation you need to comply with  different type of licenses and different type  of copyright related restrictions so even if they  are open source you may not be able to use them in  your project either so there are different type of  situations in which you don't have access to real  data and learning how to create a synthetic dataset  is a very important skill for sure, because  you can just go ahead and create your own data  to train your models, so let me show you, we will  be using chatgpt and we will be using chatgpt user  interface, we will be using exactly this user  interface over here in chat.openai.com and this  is going to be enough in order to show you the  overall process of how I create this synthetic  dataset, technically, ideally, we should be using  something like the openai API or we should be using  some python functions or some python code in order  to create this dataset because by doing so we  would have much more control on everything that's  going to be generated, right, you're are going to  see what I mean later on, but just remember that  we are going to use chatgpt and we're going to use  this user interface only as a way to show you  the overall process but technically if we  would use some python code we would do this  process much faster and much better and much more  efficiently and so on, so we will be generating a  sentiment analysis dataset and more specifically  we will be creating a dataset of product reviews,  so we are going to have many product reviews and  for every single one of our reviews we are going  to have a label which will be either positive  or negative, right, and the label will be the  sentiment of that review and this is the dataset  we will be generating today, and in a future  tutorial I'm going to show you how to use this  dataset in order to train a machine learning  model but for now let's take it one step at a time  so the first thing I'm going to do is I'm going  to tell chatgpt exactly what we will be doing today  so I will be creating some context so chatgpt knows  what this project is about and I will be saying  something like this: I'm preparing a sentiment  analysis synthetic dataset of product reviews,  the label is binary: positive or negative, give  me 10 reviews and their sentiment. And this is what we  got, for example this review over here this product  exceeded my expectations it's absolutely fantastic  and worth every penny and this is an example of a  positive review then I was really disappointed  with this product it didn't work as advertised  and it was a waste of money and this is  an example of a negative review then I love this  product it changed my life for the better, highly  recommend it to everyone and this is another  example of another positive review and then  another example terrible quality broke after just  a few uses definitely not worth the price and this  another negative review so this is the type of  content we will be generating and this is how we  will be creating our synthetic dataset, and there  are many things I have to say from here the first  one is that at the end of all this process we  will ask chatgpt to give us this dataset in a CSV  format, right, it will be much better in order to  generate our dataset in order to just work with  this dataset so that's something we are going to  do later on on this tutorial but for now as we  are just playing around as we are just starting  with this process this is what we got, right, this  is really not the format we are going to generate  later on, and then another thing which is very  important when you create a synthetic dataset you  obviously want to make this dataset as similar  as possible to the real data, right, obviously  that's the entire purpose of creating a synthetic  dataset that you will be creating something that  looks like the real data so you want to create  a very diverse dataset which kind of looks like  the diversity you will have in a real dataset  and if I look at all of these reviews over here  the first thing I notice is that all of these  reviews are very extreme, right, absolutely every  single one of these reviews is super positive or  super negative and that's perfectly fine because  these are product reviews but the way it works  in real life there are many reviews which are  positive but are slightly positive and there are  other reviews which are negative but only slightly  negative and also there are many other reviews  which is really hard to tell if it's positive  or negative right many reviews which are kind of neutral, we want this datset to look as  real as possible so we are going to create other  reviews other type of reviews which are going to  be much more diverse so this is what we are going  to do next, give me 10 reviews and their sentiment but  now let's let's ask chatgpt not a binary label but  let's make something a little more complex, sentiment  should be an integer between - 3 and 3,  -3 is the most negative sentiment and 3 is  the most positive sentiment and let's see what  happens and this is what we got so for example  we have: absolutely dreadful product broke within  minutes of use and this is a very negative review  this is like the most negative review then very  disappointed with this purchase doesn't live  up to the hype, right, we have all these words over  here I'm not sure how realistic these words are  I think people doesn't really speak like this  but it doesn't matter and this is a negative  review but not so negative as the other one then  average product nothing special about it this  is a negative review but only slightly negative  right and then the same happens with the positive  reviews a good product overall does the job well  slightly positive then extremely satisfied with  this purchase exactly what I needed and this is  a super positive review and so on right so by  doing this change over here now we have much more  diversity in the reviews we are getting from chatgp...  -3 the most negative sentiment and  3 the most positive sentiment, I'm going to  ask 10 reviews too now give me 10 reviews and  I'm going to do something else because you can  see that each one of the reviews we are getting  over here they are very well written, right, you  can see that we have all the punctuation over here  we have everything starting with an uppercase we  have everything like very nice looking right  and the way people write the reviews usually  you will have many people who really writes  like this and then you will have many other  people who just use a much more informal type of  writing right so let's ask chatgpt... use a more informal writing...do not respect punctuation...nor upper cases

The tutorial aims to teach participants how to create a synthetic dataset for sentiment analysis, specifically focused on product reviews, using ChatGPT. Here are the key outcomes and points from the text:

1. **Importance of Synthetic Datasets**: The tutorial emphasizes the value of learning to create synthetic datasets, especially for machine learning engineers. It highlights scenarios where real data may not be available due to various limitations such as project specificity, licensing issues, or copyright restrictions.

2. **Objective**: The specific goal is to generate a dataset of product reviews labeled as either positive or negative.

3. **Using ChatGPT**: The instructor plans to use the ChatGPT user interface to guide participants through the process of generating the dataset. While acknowledging that using the OpenAI API or Python code would provide more control and efficiency, the tutorial focuses on a step-by-step approach using ChatGPT.

4. **Dataset Characteristics**: The initial dataset generated contains extreme reviews—either very positive or very negative. The instructor points out the need for diversity in sentiments to better mimic real-world data, which includes varying degrees of positivity and negativity, as well as neutral sentiments.

5. **Refinement Process**: To improve the dataset's realism, the instructor proposes to adjust the sentiment labels to a scale of -3 (most negative) to +3 (most positive) instead of binary labels. This allows for more nuanced feedback and a diverse range of reviews.

6. **Informal Writing Style**: A further consideration is to generate reviews that reflect the informal writing styles of actual users. The instructor plans to ask ChatGPT to simulate this by disregarding proper punctuation and standard capitalization.

7. **Future Applications**: The dataset created in the tutorial will be used in later tutorials to train machine learning models, reinforcing the practical importance of the synthetically generated data.


... let's see now,okay now we have something  which looks much nicer for sure and this is what  we got this product sucks and this is a very  negative review I am disappointed with it and  this is a a negative review but not so negative  like the other one and you can see that we have a  much different style of writing that we had over  here right much different style, just okay,  it's awesome, works like a charm, not bad, waste of  money, love it, pretty good, not impressed, right, so  you can see that we have even more diversity  because there will be many people who really  write the reviews like this and then there  will be other people who just writes like this, now  let's do a little more... let's ask chatgpt for a  little more diversity, now let's use an extremely formal...extremely formal writing... each review should be more  than 300 characters long, right, because you  we know that there are many people who write very  long reviews, some very very super curated reviews,  and yeah we want to have a very diverse  dataset, this is key, every time you create  a synthetic dataset you want your dataset to be  as diverse as possible because you want this dataset  to resemble the real data and the real data  will be super diverse so for example... in light of  my extensive examination I am pleased to pronounce  this product as truly remarkable it's exceptional  performance surpasses all anticipations evoking  a profound sense of satisfaction hence it merits  the highest sentiment of 3... I see that it's  not really complying with the CSV format right  but nevertheless you get the idea and please  mind that chatgpt very often makes mistakes I'm  not sure if very often but sometimes it makes  mistakes so you will need to be on top of all  the results to make sure everything complies  with everything you are asking chatgpt, I have seen  that when we have many restrictions for example  here we are asking 10 reviews CSV format two  columns the sentiment from -3 to 3.  extremely formal writing 300 characters long  we have many restrictions, we are not going to  see some of the restrictions or some of the  things we are asking chatgpt, for example in this  case we are asking for a csv format and this is  not in csv format but nevertheless remember that  this tutorial is only to show you how to create  a synthetic dataset, to show you the overall  process of how to create a synthetic dataset,  so obviously there are many things we could do  much better or we could improve in this process  but this is only to show you the overall idea of  how to do it remember that chatgpt is an amazing tool  but sometimes it makes mistake and as a matter of  fact we have a text over here which says chatgpt can  make mistakes so we we will have some mistakes  from time to time so just you need to  remember that you need to be on top of all the  results and everything that's being generated  because sometimes it will not comply with what  you have asked chatgpt, but nevermind let's continue  with this process, so basically we are generating a  very diverse dataset, we are generating this dataset  in CSV format and we are making different  type of diversities right we have different  graduations of the positive and the negative sentiments,  and we also have a longer text we have shorter text  and also we have more formal and more informal  writing now let's make something with grammar  mistakes because there are many people who also  writes with a very informal and very... wrong  writing right with many... with a lot of grammar  mistakes, so I'm going to say something like this...Now give me 10 reviews in CSV format two  columns text and sentiment, sentiment  is an integer from -3 to 3, -3 is  the most negative sentiment and 3 the most  positive sentiment, with a lot of syntax mistakes  and informal writing, each review should be less  than 20 characters long. And you can see that now  we have 'this sucks' with an X at the end I hate  it it's okay it's great with an 8, it works  good not bad waste money love it and this is  also very realistic because there are many people  who really writes a review like this right so  you get the idea of what we are trying to do  over here and now what I'm going to do is to  ask chatgpt to provide many reviews at once and we are  going to start creating this dataset so this  is how I'm going to do I have prepared something  over here and you can see that this is the text  we are going to input into chatgpt which is exactly  what we have... like the overall idea of what we  have done so far we are going to ask for product  reviews and sentiment, the sentiment should be an  integer and actually should be a signed integer  because we only care about the positives and  the negatives and we don't really care about all  these reviews which are generated as zero right  because technically this is not positive and  it's not negative either so we are going to ask  for signed integers and ranging from -3 to  3, -3 is the most negative one, 3 is  the most positive and the 60 reviews should be  comprised as follow... not only we want to have a  very diverse dataset but we also want to have  pretty much the same amount of data in all of  our categories right so this is going to be a  way to... to create this diversity, then give me the  result in csv format two columns one of them is  the text of the review and the other one is the  sentiment and let's just start with this, so this  is what we got, these are all the reviews we got  and you can see that we are making progress for  sure because now we are making... we are producing  a lot of reviews, we are producing everything in  exactly the same format we are looking for  right we are producing a CSV file or a CSV type  of structure and we have many many reviews and  this is a very balanced dataset because all of  our categories have the same amount of objects  now something that's very important remember  we are actually creating a binary dataset, right  all of our labels are actually binary all of our  labels are either positive or negative so at the  end of this process once we have finalized all the  content creation all the reviews creation we are  just going to replace all these numbers by the  sentiment right by either positive or negative  we are going to replace all the numbers  -3, -2 and -1 by negative and we're  going to replace all the numbers 1 2 and 3  by the the word 'positive', right, remember at the end  we are creating a binary label we are creating  a synthetic dataset with only two sentiments, positive  or negative, but this is only something we are  doing in the meanwhile only to make sure we are  creating a more balanced dataset and a more diverse  dataset, so let's continue now we're going to create  exactly the same but I'm going to input something  like... this thing we did over here... and let's see  what happened with a lot of syntax mistakes and  informal writing each review should be less than  20 characters long... and that should be pretty much  all, and this is what we got you can see that for  example unbelievable incredible the best these  are... perfection, these are like the most positive  reviews and then we also have all the other ones,  okay I guess, not the worst, kinda okay, junk,  and so on I think this is the type of text I like  the most because I think this is the most real one  right people really speak like this when they are  writing a review, and now we are going to do the same for  example with the extremely formal writing and by  now you got the idea, extremely formal... writing,  right we are just going to repeat the same process  many times and we are just going to generate a lot  of reviews and then the only thing we're going  to do is to copy all of these reviews together  and we are just going to create a huge csv file  okay so this is what it generated and you can  see that now we are complying with the format  we asked chatgpt right this is a CSV format and  something I have noticed when I was preparing  this tutorial and I notice the same issue now  that after a few times, a few iterations, chatgpt  starts to repeat a lot of the reviews right  you can see that the text is pretty much the same,  is exactly the same in this two reviews over here  the same happens over here the same happens over  here, over here, over here, so there are many reviews  which are just repeating theirselves right we  have a lot of diversity over here and then we  start to get all these repetitions over here so  this is something we need to be very careful and  we will need to curate a lot of these reviews  later on right once we are creating the dataset  we need to curate all of this content over  here, let's do something different which is also  going to make a much more diverse dataset, let's  create... each review less than 30 characterslong do not respect upper cases nor punctuation  and let's ask chatgpt to make product reviews  about a very specific product which is another  way to make this dataset more diverse because  some of the reviews will be very generic, people  will say things like this something super generic  which will apply to absolutely any type of  product but there will be other people which  will make some comments about a very specific  product which was the product that person  bought right so let's ask chatgpt to give us some  reviews about earplugs for sleeping, which by  the way it's a product I do buy every once in a  while, I test different brands and different type  of earplugs and so on, so let's see what happens  if we ask chatgpt for product reviews but about a  very specific product let's see what happens, you  can see that we have many reviews which are very  generic but then we have other reviews which are  more specific to what a review about earplugs for  sleeping could could look like right for example  this one is about how uncomfortable it is then  annoying, noisy, okay yeah it could be, can't sleep  uncomfortable, hurt ears, right, this is definitely  very... a very appropriate review for an earplug  for sleeping, now let's make it without the restriction...and I see the reviews it generated it seems it  remembers the last... input we put into chatgpt so  it's generating the same type of reviews, I'm  going to ask for each review around 200 characters  long, respect upper cases, and you can see that now  we got longer reviews, we have the same issue as  before some of the reviews look very similar so  we will need to curate all of these reviews later  on but then we have many reviews which are more  specific to the type of product we are reviewing,  right, so I cannot sleep with these earplugs in  they are useless and don't block out any noise  that's very specific to the type of product we are  using, they don't block out any noise, too big  for my ears, let's see a positive  review... we have one over here impressed these  ear plugs are fantastic at blocking out noise  and comfortable to wear so this is exactly what  we have using this input over here and this is the  overall process of how to generate a sentiment  analysis synthetic dataset with chatgpt, I'm  going to keep on trying different inputs, different  prompts, so I generate a very diverse dataset and  then at the end I am going to curate all of these  issues we have over here, of all of these different  reviews which are just repeating their themselves,  right, you can see it's pretty much the same review  but it's repeating itself once and again so I'm  going to curate all of these issues and then I  am going to post the dataset I am generating  in this tutorial in my Patreon so it's going to  be available to all my Patreon supporters, if you  want to download exactly the same dataset I am  generating right now you are going to find this  dataset in my Patreon, this is going to be all  for this tutorial and I also invite you to take  a look at one of my previous videos where I show  you how to create an emotion recognition synthetic  dataset, I show you how to generate human faces  so we can train an emotion recognition model so  I invite you to take a look at that video  over there and this is going to be all for  this tutorial, my name is Felipe, I'm a computer  vision engineer and see you on my next video.


The text outlines a tutorial on generating a synthetic dataset for sentiment analysis using product reviews. Here are the main outcomes:

1. **Diversity in Reviews**: The tutorial emphasizes the importance of creating a diverse dataset that mimics the variety of real-world reviews, incorporating different styles (formal, informal), lengths (short vs. long), and sentiments (negative, positive).

2. **Review Examples**: It provides examples of reviews with varying sentiments and formats, showing contrasts between highly negative and positive language. 

3. **CSV Format**: There’s a focus on structuring the data in CSV format, with two primary columns—review text and sentiment value (from -3 to 3)—to facilitate later analysis.

4. **Sentiment Classification**: The tutorial explains transitioning from numeric sentiment values to binary labels (positive/negative). The final dataset is intended to contain an equal distribution of sentiments.

5. **Handling Errors**: It highlights potential mistakes by the AI (e.g., format issues or repetitive content) and discusses the necessity of manual curation to ensure quality and diversity.

6. **Specificity in Product Reviews**: The process includes generating reviews for a specific product (e.g., earplugs for sleeping) to increase contextual relevance and realism, showcasing examples of both positive and negative feedback.

7. **Final Dataset Availability**: The author mentions sharing the curated dataset with supporters on Patreon, encouraging viewers to engage with previous content related to synthetic dataset creation for emotion recognition.

8. **Continuous Improvement**: The tutorial encourages trying different prompts to refine the dataset further and improve its applicability for sentiment analysis tasks. 

Overall, the tutorial serves as a practical guide for generating and curating a synthetic dataset suitable for sentiment analysis using AI-generated product reviews.
